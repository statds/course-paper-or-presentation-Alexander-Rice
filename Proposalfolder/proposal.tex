\paragraph{Introduction}
Though a relatively new entertainment industry when compared with the film or music industries, video games have proven to bring in a 
significant amount of revenue for their creators and publishers. According to IBISWorld, the size of the video game market was estimated
 as 97.67 billion USD in 2022 ~\citep[(A)][]{Marketsizestat}.  In this blossoming industry, it is important for prospective developers 
 to analyze what factors go into making a successful game, considering the sizable budgets and time going into developing games. 

Previous analysis has been done on this topic, namely in Sacranie's paper "Consumer Perceptions \& Video Game Sales: A Meeting of the Minds", 
which focuses mainly on critic reviews in it's analysis, while also including variables such as genre and platform in order to construct 
linear and non-linear models for game sales from 2007-2009, concluding that there seems to be a link between game quality and game sales 
~\citep[(B)][]{Sacranie2010Analysis}. In addition, Babb's paper "Comparing Video Game Sales by Gaming Platform" does additional analysis 
utilizing a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the sales in relation to the hardware they were released on ~\citep[(C)][]{Babb2013Analysis}. 
In this paper, I plan to further the analysis done by others, using a different data set with many more observations over a large period 
of time, and analyzing it using various statistical tests.


\paragraph{Specific Aims}
The main aim to address with the data is to analyze the trends in video game sales. Mainly, I will be attempting to answer the question,
 "What factors go into making a game sell well?" To approach this, I will use a data set containing top selling games, along with 
 information pertaining to their release, and analyzing which of these aspects are related to success.

\paragraph{Data}
The data set being used is called "Video Game Sales Dataset Updated -Extra Feat". It originates from Kaggle, posted by user 
Ibrahim Muhammad Naeem, and contains data compiled from vgcharts containing spanning from 1980 to 2016 ~\citep[(D)][]{maindataset}. 
The data includes information on the names of the games, platform of release, year of  release, genre, publisher, sales numbers 
from different markets, the critic score, the critic count, user score, user count , developer, and rating.
